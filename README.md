# Hello-World
My first GitHub repository 

My open source name is KaChEng5225. I am a chemical engineer graduating from the University of Mississippi May 12th, 2018. 
I am going to work for a chemical company to produce household cleaning products, and am experimenting using GitHub for my projects and the master schedule, the inventory counts, and other related duties. 

I also have a few ideas for dApps, and will be drafting them using GitHub. The collaboration with the world idea is very appealing to me.
